We have to announce, MCPE Toolbox wont work above iOS 12.5.
The reason to this is well, we could not get it working above iOS 12.5 anymore.
Why?
Because Microsoft & Apple patched the exploit that MCPE Toolbox was based on.
This means when someone below iOS 12.5 runs the shortcut it will work. When someone above iOS 12.5 runs the shortcut, it will simply show a result saying how their version is to high. Now we are not saying even if you are on iOS 12.5 it will work, because MCPE Toolbox is not as good as it once was. But be glad it still supports iOS 12.5 and under. The MCPE Toolbox download is in the description on the video by Tek Freez or Toolbox Team.
We will be focusing more on MCPE World Editor, which you can find info about on the MCPE World Editor tab.
